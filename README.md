#Test Case Bulk Editor

This repository makes it easy for problem-setters to bulk edit test-cases.


###Who should use this repository?

This repository was mainly targeted to help HackerRank.com problem-setters to bulk edit test-cases. But if you can do some very very tiny modification, it can be useful for other problem-setter's too.

###Why problem-setters need this tool?

Imagine you have made 30 test cases with 1-based indexing, now for some reason you need to modify them all. This script makes it as easy as just reading and writing inputs.
