### Who should use this repository?

This repository was mainly targeted to help HackerRank.com problem-setters to bulk edit test-cases. But if you can do some very very tiny modification, it can be useful for other problem-setter's too.

### Why problem-setters need this tool?

Imagine you have made 30 test cases with 1-based indexing, now for some reason you need to modify them all. This script makes it as easy as just reading and writing inputs.


### Example

Imagine all your test cases contains 3 integers on the same line. You need to modify the files and put them on separate lines. The screenshot below shows how to do it:
